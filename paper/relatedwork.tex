\paragraph{Parallel SVM}
Parallel SVM algorithms can broadly be classified into explicit and implicit approaches. Explicit approaches identify  independent components of the problem and use parallel frameworks such as OpenMP, MPI, CUDA/OpenCL or MapReduce to directly encode this parallelism. Implicit approaches represent the calculations required for the SVM problem via matrix operations for which highly optimized parallel libraries exist. These approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages some of which we will discuss below. A detailed comparison and empirical analysis of popular explicit and implicit approaches on CPUs and GPUs is presented in.
