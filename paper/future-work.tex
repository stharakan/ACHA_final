There are various parts to this project which we were not yet able to address:
\begin{itemize}
	\item We would like to see empirically how sparsity affects each of the methods we 
		have looked at to compare with the theory. In 
		\cite{wotao}, they had some results, but not for most of the matrices we 
		compared here. 
	\item We did most minimizations in the $TV$ norm, but we would like to see an 
		implementation of an ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers) on an
		objective function containing both the $L_1$ and the $TV$ norms. \cite{wotao}
		implemented this, but not with the randomizations discussed here. 
\end{itemize}
