1D examples shamelessly stolen from
\href{http://compsens.eecs.umich.edu/sensing_tutorial.php}{\textcolor{blue}{http://compsens.eecs.umich.edu/sensing\_tutorial.php}}

In these 1D examples we solve the problem
\begin{align*}
	\min \norm{x}_{\ell_1} \text{ subject to } \norm{Ax - y}_{\ell_2} \leq \epsilon
\end{align*}

using the package \href{http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~justin/l1magic/}{\textcolor{blue}{$\ell_1$-MAGIC}} to perform the optimization.

All else equal, smaller images don't perform as well. We need a high ratio of image size to number of samples
to be able to reconstruct it well.
