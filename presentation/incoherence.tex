Given an exactly sparse or a compressible signal, we solve

\begin{align*}
	\min \norm{x}_{\ell_1} \text{ subject to } \norm{Ax - y}_{\ell_2} \leq \epsilon
\end{align*}

with added Gaussian white noise with standard deviation $\sigma\in [0.01,0.5]$.

How much data do we really need? Using an SNR of 4.5 we did some tests.
