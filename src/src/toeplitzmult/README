This directory contains MATLAB functions for the fast multiplication
of a Toeplitz matrix times a vector.  By using these routines you can
avoid storing the entire matrix (using two vectors of lenght n rather
than a matrix of size n*n), and also dramatically speedup the
multiplication.

The simplest case involves the multiplication of a Toeplitz matrix
times a single vector.  To multiply toeplitz(a,b) times x, use

>> y=toeplitzmult(a,b,x)   

If you have a single matrix that will be multiplied times many
vectors, then use

>> F=toeplitzmultaux(a,b);
>> y1=toeplitzmult2(F,x1);
>> y2=toeplitzmult2(F,x2);
>> y3=toeplitzmult2(F,x3);
...
 
The script example.m demonstrates the use of these functions.

Note that this code works correctly with matrices and vectors that
are real or complex.  However, due to round-off errors, the product
might have a small imaginary component even though a,b, and x are
all real.  To correct this, simply use
 
  real(toeplitz(a,b,x))

A good introduction to how these algorithms work can be found in the
book "Matrix Computations, 3rd ed." by Golub and Van Loan.
